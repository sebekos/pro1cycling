            All of the training, the hours on the bike, the measuring of
            calories, the rest days that aren’t really rest days, the building
            up, the tapering off, the sprints and the recovery. It’s all led to
            this moment when TJ is feeling good and Mig is on his A-game, when
            the guys are coming off a win and the next is just within grasp.
            It’s time to show up. It’s #BOOMTIME. And afterward, once they’ve
            crushed it and taken the title, they don’t hold back in celebrating.
            Because riding bikes is fun.
